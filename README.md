# Spring - RESTful API
This project was made along with a YouTube Tech tutorial video for an English class at college. The web application is a Spring Boot application, which uses Spring Data JPA and the H2 Database. The web app consists only of one API controller, which is responsible for adding, removing and getting customers by names.

Below you can see the mappings of the API methods
